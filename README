Validates that the search results display 5 entries out of 24 total entries.

Selenium library for Python

Setup Instructions

Install Selenium:

pip install selenium


Run the script:

python -v -s  searchfunction.py.py

Notes

The script includes a small delay (time.sleep(2)) to ensure the table updates before validation.

The script uses Xpath selectors to locate the search box and table rows.

If the test fails, the assertion error message will indicate the number of results found.
